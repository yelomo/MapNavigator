This is a fork of the [MapNavigator by tyczj](https://github.com/tyczj/MapNavigator).

The original MapNavigator was transfered into a Android library project built with gradle.
The final MapNavigator.aar can be found here https://github.com/yelomo/MapNavigator/tree/master/MapNavigator/dist

Added functionality
============
* ```getDistance()``` and ```getDuration()``` added in Direction
* Navigator can additionally be created without a GoogleMaps Instance to calculate distance and duration
